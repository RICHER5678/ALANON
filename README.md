# ALANON
Al-Anon Family Groups Uganda is there for anyone whose life is or has been affected by someone else’s drinking.

Our members provide meetings in all major towns and cities and are committed to being there for you when you need help. Whatever your relationship with the drinker, you will find other people who have similar stories to tell. You will realise that you are not alone.
